## Q: What is this repository for?
### A: Keeping train.

## ed why is this project being made?
### A: The format of Collada had been developed by khronos community for more than a decade. It is widely supported by 3D composing software and 3D engines. But the weakness of khronos community on development ability and control capability gives Collada other names of incompatibility and disability. I work on Collada many years before but now when I have to do some work on Collada format, I found I have to do hard coding from low level XML parsing. Re-inventing wheels on such a task did take time. I hope every 3D developers abandon Collada format right now and move to the next generation of 3D format.
